# Welcome to Hatch!
## What is Hatch?
Hatch is a new social media platform for sharing projects made with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/about) or [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/) (A popular Scratch modification). Scratch is a great site for learning programming, but it is designed for young kids. Many users find themselves outgrowing it as they get older. We have also heard distaste from the Scratch community about adding new features to Scratch. So, all of this is why we decided to make our own platform, inspired by Scratch. We are very similar to Scratch, with the major differences being that we have more relaxed rules and a more active and listening development team.

Hatch is not intended as a replacement for Scratch; it is intended as somewhere to go for users who grow out of Scratch.

Hatch is currently in development and the site may be buggy at this time.
